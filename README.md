## How to play?
* The game is played on a grid of 3 by 3 squares. 
* You have the option to pick to play against the computer or a second player. 
* If you select X, your opponent will play as O. 
* Players take turns putting their symbols in empty squares. 
* The first player to get 3 marks in a row : up, down, across or diagonally is the winner.
* If no one gets the 3 marks in a row and the 9 squares are full, the game is over with no winners.

## Flow Chart
Before starting the game, I have created the structure in the following chart I have made using [Lucid Charts](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/). The chart initially did not have all the features I eventually included in the app, only the game and the how to play section. I have added the 'print scores' section while working on the game.
